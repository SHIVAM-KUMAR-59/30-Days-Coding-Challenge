     There is an integer array nums sorted in ascending order (with distinct values).
     Prior to being passed to your function, nums is possibly rotated at an unknown pivot index such that the resulting array is [nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], 
     nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]] (0-indexed). For example, [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might be rotated at pivot index 3 and become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2].

 Given a mountain array mountainArr, return the minimum index such that mountainArr.get(index) == target. If such an index does not exist, return -1. You cannot access the mountain array directly. You may only access the array using a MountainArray interface:
 MountainArray.get(k) returns the element of the array at index k (0-indexed).
 MountainArray.length() returns the length of the array.
   Submissions making more than 100 calls to MountainArray.get will be judged Wrong Answer. Also, any solutions that attempt to circumvent the judge will result in disqualification

      <li><b>1. Merge Sort using Recursion.</b></li>
      Merge sort is a sorting algorithm that follows the divide-and-conquer approach. It works by recursively dividing the input array into smaller subarrays and sorting those subarrays then merging them back together to obtain the sorted array.

      <li><b>2. Quick Sort using Recursion.  </b></a></li>
      QuickSort is a sorting algorithm based on the Divide and Conquer algorithm that picks an element as a pivot and partitions the given array around the picked pivot by placing the pivot in its correct position in the sorted array.

      <li><a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array/description/"><b>3. Search in Rotated Sorted Array ( Medium ).</b></a></li>
     There is an integer array nums sorted in ascending order (with distinct values).

For example, [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might be rotated at pivot index 3 and become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]. Given the array nums after the possible rotation and an integer target, return the index of target if it is in nums, or -1 if it is not in nums. You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

Return the quotient after dividing dividend by divisor. Note: Assume we are dealing with an environment that could only store integers within the 32-bit signed integer range: [−231, 231 − 1].

      Write an algorithm to determine if a number n is happy. A happy number is a number defined by the following process: Starting with any positive integer replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits. Repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy. Return true if n is a happy number, and false if not.

      <li><b>1. GPS Navigation.</b><br>
      You are working on a sophisticated GPS navigation system that calculates the fastest route in the city . The city is represented by a graph where intersections are nodes and roads between them are edges with travel times. Develop a function that determines the shortest travel from a given starting intersection to all the other intersections in the city.</li>
      <li><b>2. Data Compression.</b>
You are working on a data compression project and need to minimize the space required to store a set of characters and their frequencies. One of your colleagues suggests using a tree-based approach to encode the characters efficiently. To evaluate this idea, you decide to implement a system that: 1. Reads a set of characters along with their frequencies. 2. Constructs an optimal binary tree based or tliese frequencies. 3. Generates binary codes for each character. Your task is to write a function that takes a list of characters and their corresponding frequencies, constructs the optimal tree, and returns a dictionary with characters as keys and their binary codes as values.

      <li><b>3. Vehicle Loading.</b>
      You are working on a logistics optimization system for a large-scale transportation company. The company needs to maximize the value of items transported in its fleet of vehicles, each with a different weight capacity. Each item has a specific weight and value, and some items may have-dependencies, meaning certain items must be included if another item is selected. Write a function that determines the optimal selection of items to maximize their total value while staying within the given weight capacities of multiple vehicles and respecting the dependencies between items.
